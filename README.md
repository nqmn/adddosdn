# AdDDoSDN Dataset Framework 🛡️

A comprehensive framework for generating network security datasets in Software-Defined Networks (SDN). This tool creates realistic datasets containing both normal traffic and various types of DDoS attacks for cybersecurity research and machine learning.

## 🎯 What Does This Do?

This framework helps researchers and security professionals create datasets for:
- **DDoS Attack Detection**: Training machine learning models to identify attacks
- **Network Security Research**: Studying attack patterns and defense mechanisms  
- **Cybersecurity Education**: Learning about SDN security and attack types
- **Defense System Testing**: Evaluating security tools and detection systems

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Setup Your Environment

**System Requirements:**
- Ubuntu Linux (18.04 or newer recommended)
- At least 4GB RAM and 10GB free disk space
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

**Install Required Software:**
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv git tshark mininet ryu-manager slowhttptest

# Clone this project
git clone https://github.com/nqmn/AdDDoSDN_dataset.git
cd AdDDoSDN_dataset

# Create Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r dataset_generation/requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Your First Test

**Quick Test (5 minutes):**
```bash
# Test that everything works (requires sudo for network simulation)
sudo python3 dataset_generation/test.py
```
This creates a small dataset in `dataset_generation/test_output/` with:
- 📊 `packet_features.csv` - Individual packet data (15 features)
- 📈 `flow_features.csv` - SDN flow statistics (18 features)  
- 🔄 `cicflow_features_all.csv` - Aggregated flow data (85 features)
- 📦 `*.pcap` files - Raw network packet captures
- 📝 `attack.log` - Detailed attack information

**Full Dataset Generation (1+ hours):**
```bash
# Generate full research dataset (configurable durations)
sudo python3 dataset_generation/main.py
```
This creates a comprehensive dataset in `dataset_generation/main_output/`

**Testing and Validation:**
```bash
# Run the unified test runner to validate your datasets
cd test/
python3 test_runner.py
```
This provides a menu-driven interface to run various validation scripts including timeline analysis, statistics calculation, and dataset validation.

### Step 3: Configure for Your Needs

Edit `dataset_generation/config.json` to customize attack durations:
```json
{
  "scenario_durations": {
    "normal_traffic": 1200,    "← 20 minutes of normal traffic"
    "syn_flood": 600,          "← 10 minutes of SYN flood attack"  
    "udp_flood": 600,          "← 10 minutes of UDP flood attack"
    "icmp_flood": 600,         "← 10 minutes of ICMP flood attack"
    "ad_syn": 600,             "← 10 minutes of advanced TCP attack"
    "ad_udp": 600,             "← 10 minutes of advanced HTTP attack"
    "ad_slow": 600             "← 10 minutes of slow read attack"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Three Synchronized Data Formats

The framework generates three synchronized data formats from the same network traffic, each designed for different analysis approaches:

## 🔄 Multi-Granularity Analysis Design

### **Real-Time Analysis Formats** (Network Operations)

#### **Format 1: Packet-Level Features (15 features)**
**Granularity**: Individual network packets  
**Source**: Direct PCAP extraction using tshark  
**Analysis Type**: **Real-time packet inspection**  
**Use case**: Packet-level ML models, protocol analysis, immediate threat detection

**Why packet-level for real-time:**
- **Instant detection**: Each packet analyzed immediately as it arrives
- **Low latency**: Minimal processing delay for live traffic monitoring
- **Protocol-specific**: Detect attacks based on packet headers and flags
- **Network hardware compatible**: Can be implemented in switches/routers
- **Fine-grained**: Catches attacks that may be invisible at flow level
| Feature Name | Description | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp` | Timestamp of the packet capture. | Essential for temporal analysis and correlating events. |
| `packet_length` | Length of the captured packet in bytes. | Indicates packet size, useful for identifying anomalies (e.g., unusually large or small packets). |
| `eth_type` | Ethernet type of the packet (e.g., IP, ARP). | Identifies the network layer protocol, crucial for protocol-specific analysis. |
| `ip_src` | Source IP address of the packet. | Identifies the sender, vital for tracing attack sources. |
| `ip_dst` | Destination IP address of the packet. | Identifies the receiver, vital for tracing attack targets. |
| `ip_proto` | IP protocol number (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP). | Specifies the transport layer protocol, fundamental for classifying traffic types. |
| `ip_ttl` | IP Time-To-Live value. | Can indicate network topology or unusual routing paths, sometimes manipulated in attacks. |
| `ip_id` | IP identification field. | Used for reassembling fragmented IP packets, can be used in some attack patterns. |
| `ip_flags` | IP flags (e.g., Don't Fragment). | Indicates fragmentation status, relevant for certain attack types. |
| `ip_len` | Total length of the IP packet. | Similar to `packet_length` but specific to the IP layer, useful for anomaly detection. |
| `src_port` | Source port number (TCP/UDP). | Identifies the application sending the traffic, crucial for application-layer attack detection. |
| `dst_port` | Destination port number (TCP/UDP). | Identifies the application receiving the traffic, crucial for application-layer attack detection. |
| `tcp_flags` | TCP flags (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN). | Essential for analyzing TCP connection states and identifying SYN floods or other TCP-based attacks. |
| `Label_multi` | Multi-class label indicating the type of traffic (e.g., 'normal', 'syn_flood', 'udp_flood'). | Primary label for multi-class classification tasks. |
| `Label_binary` | Binary label indicating whether the traffic is normal (0) or attack (1). | Primary label for binary classification tasks. |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Network Simulation
- Uses Mininet to create virtual networks
- Simulates real SDN environment with OpenFlow
- No actual network traffic leaves your computer
- Safe for educational and research use

### System Impact
- Requires sudo access for network simulation
- May temporarily use network resources
- Automatically cleans up after completion
- Safe shutdown with Ctrl+C

**This framework is for DEFENSIVE security research only!**

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

The framework includes a comprehensive test suite located in the `test/` directory to validate dataset quality and generation processes.

### Unified Test Runner
```bash
cd test/
python3 test_runner.py
```

The test runner provides an interactive menu with the following validation tools:

1. **Timeline Analysis** - Analyze synchronization between packet and flow features
2. **Statistics Calculation** - Calculate attack type distributions and percentages
3. **File Ownership Management** - Change file ownership (requires sudo)
4. **PCAP Timestamp Validation** - Validate timestamps in captured packets
5. **CICFlow Feature Extraction** - Extract network flow features using CICFlowMeter
6. **PCAP Processing** - Process PCAP files to labeled CSV features
7. **Dataset Validation** - Comprehensive validation of generated datasets

### Key Validation Features
- **Timeline Synchronization**: Ensures packet and flow data alignment
- **Protocol Correctness**: Validates TCP/UDP/ICMP protocol encoding
- **Attack Classification**: Verifies multi-class and binary label consistency
- **Enhanced Attack Detection**: Confirms realistic timing patterns in traditional attacks
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides comprehensive dataset statistics and distributions

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Validate a test dataset
cd test/
python3 test_runner.py
# Select option 1 (Timeline Analysis)
# Select option 2 (Calculate Statistics)

# Extract and validate CICFlow features
python3 test_runner.py
# Select option 5 (Extract CICFlow Features)
# Select option 7 (Validate CICFlow Dataset)
